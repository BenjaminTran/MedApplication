My research experience began my freshman year at Rice University with Professor
Wei Li, Ph.D. in the Nuclear and Particle Physics division. Professor Li's
research group studies the correlation of particles produced in heavy-ion
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis of particle correlations
allows one to measure properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the supposed
state of the universe shortly after the Big Bang.

My first project with Professor Li was an independent analysis of the
distribution of charged particles produced in collisions. The objective was to
utilize the statistical method of Bayesian unfolding to remove, or deconvolve,
detector distortions and background from observed data. In this experience, I
learned to use ROOT, a data analysis framework built on C-plus-plus that is used
for particle physics analyses, and began to accumulate skills in computational
data analysis methods.

The summer after my sophomore year, I received a grant to work for the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in
Meyrin, Switzerland on a detector project for ten weeks. I was tasked with
developing the software for the channel monitoring system for a new subdetector
addition to the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment as well as performing
tracker algorithm efficiency studies for Professor Li's research group. As a
result, I expanded my programming skills in several languages including
C-plus-plus and python. This experience also developed my leadership and
teamwork skills through the undertaking of large responsibilities. For instance,
my channel monitoring system is in use at all times during LHC operation, making
it a vital asset to the monitoring team. Also, as the main developer for the
system, I called meetings with the monitoring team to discuss the feature
developments of the system and presented reports to the subdetector commission
committee.

Upon my return from CERN, I worked on an analysis project to measure the
elliptic flow of a particle called the Xi baryon in proton-lead collisions. The
goal was to test a model of the QGP, which assumed hydrodynamic behavior. If the
hydrodynamic assumption were correct, then the elliptic flow of different
particle species would exhibit an inverse relationship with their mass.
I planned to compare the elliptic flow of the Xi baryon to two other particle
species, the Kaon and Lambda, that had been previously measured. Since the
elliptic flow of the Xi had not been measured before, I was required to build up
the analysis from scratch. I developed the foundations of this analysis
throughout my junior year writing the analysis code for the reconstruction of Xi
baryons from collision data.

The summer following my junior year, I decided to suspend my work with Professor
Li to explore medical physics through an internship with MD Anderson Cancer
Center. I worked with Professor Song Gao, Ph.D. on the qualification of a 2D
ionization chamber array (ICA) for beam quality assurance of linear
accelerators. The 2D ICA provided a fast method to measure beam profiles and
radiation dose. Therefore, it was intended to replace the current quality
assurance scanner, which required a tedious setup procedure. I applied the
programming skills I obtained from my particle physics research to write batch
scripts to extract the data from the collection software and analyze them in
Excel. We found that the 2D ionization chamber performs on par with the previous
scanner and qualifies as an appropriate replacement. The analysis is currently
being written into a publication.

In my senior year, I resumed my work with Professor Li on the Xi analysis
project, which became my undergraduate thesis. I demonstrated that there is an
inverse relationship between the elliptic flow of the Xi, Kaon, and Lambda
particles with their mass as expected by the hydrodynamic assumption. I
presented a poster of my work at the Rice Undergraduate Natural Sciences
Symposium. In addition, I wrote my work in to a thesis and successfully defended
it. I also received the Claude W. Heaps Prize from the Department of Physics and
Astronomy for my work.

Professor Li has since hired me as a full-time researcher for the next year.
During this time, I will expand my thesis work to include the elliptic flow
measurement of the Omega baryon providing a complete analysis that I will
publish. There are tentative plans for my return to CERN where I will assist in
the redevelopment of the CMS Web Based Monitoring system from January to June of
2018.
