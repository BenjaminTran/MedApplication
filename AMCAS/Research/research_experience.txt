My research experience began my freshman year at Rice University with Professor
Wei Li, Ph.D. studying the correlation of particles produced in heavy-ion
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis of particle correlations
allows one to measure properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the supposed
state of the universe shortly after the Big Bang. QGP is produced in heavy-ion
collisions between nuclei such as in lead-lead or proton-lead collisions. My
first project was an independent analysis of the distribution of charged
particles produced in collisions. The objective was to utilize the statistical
method of Bayesian unfolding to remove, or deconvolve, detector distortions and
background from observed data. In this experience, I learned to use ROOT, a data
analysis framework program, and began to accumulate skills in computational data
analysis methods.

The summer following my sophomore year, I was given the opportunity to work for
the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) in Meyrin, Switzerland on a detector project. I was tasked with
developing the software for the channel monitoring component of the online
monitoring system for a new subdetector addition to the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) experiment. My channel monitoring component is in use at all times during
LHC operation. In addition to improving my coding abilities and my knowledge of
how the detector works, I gained experience working in a team environment and
was responsible for calling meetings with members of the monitoring team to
discuss development.
