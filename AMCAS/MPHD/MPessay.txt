Four years of exploring physics through study and research has directed my growth in thinking creatively about open-ended problems and applying my knowledge to understand processes and concepts. Combining my interest in the clinical setting with my love for scientific investigation, I want to pursue a
dual degree M.D./Ph.D. so that I can play a personal role in impacting individual patient's lives and also lead the search for discoveries that lead to better outcomes for patients. 
My research experience with Wei Li, Ph.D., in high-energy physics has developed my passion for scientific investigation and effective communication. Under his direction, I learned many skills required to conduct organized research effectively. Working on independent research projects has forced me to think creatively to troubleshoot and to solve experimental design problems requiring exploring the deeper concepts of the field. This continual exploration and creativity are both aspects that I have come to appreciate about the process of scientific discovery. But, communication of these discoveries is also key to scientific advancement. My desire to communicate my work originates from my experiences at CERN, where I collaborated with teams of physicists, and in the coalescence of my work into a senior thesis, where discussions of both my work and my peers' work expanded the scope of my knowledge and highlighted the importance of communication. 
The interdisciplinary nature of research is among its most appealing facets. I can explore my interests that exist outside the immediate scope of the clinical and medical field and integrate them into medicine in novel ways. Furthermore, it leads me to new interests in areas that I had previously overlooked fostering new directions and perspectives. For instance, my undergraduate research and education has led me to an interest in computational science, which drives my current research interest in medicine. I want to apply my programming background to advance the application of machine learning and computer vision in an area of medicine such as imaging, bioinformatics, or personalized medicine, to name a few.
The dual degree provides doors to all of my career aspirations. In the clinic, I am working on the front lines of medicine where I can develop relationships with patients and see, in real time, the innovations that would benefit medicine. In the lab, I have the freedom to ponder and solve abstract problems involving the intersection of different fields, which allows me to explore the interests that I have found during my undergraduate experience, while simultaneously contributing to humanity's struggle in fighting illness. Together, they make me an effective physician-scientist providing care to patients by joining the bridge between discoveries in the lab and their application in the clinic.

My zeal for research stems from my creative personality and my intense curiosity
in many fields. Research is a sandbox of ideas with communities of experts
communicating discoveries of fundamental principles with the end goal of
building solutions to increasingly complex problems. The clinic sees the use of
these solutions to provide better care to patients. The dual degree provides me
doors to all of my career aspirations. In the clinic, I am working on the front

clinic or lab. 

Scientific investigation as a sandbox of ideas from different fields intrigues
me the most.

The interdisciplinary approach in this field of research has also uncovered my
interests in algorithmic programming, which I was able to use during my medical
physics internship, and working with big data. I look forward to the continual
learning 

It has also opened the possibility for me to apply my knowledge in fields such
as bioinformatics or computational biology. 

Overall, I love research because it presents many opportunities to learn from a
vast variety of fields and to combine knowledge in unique ways producing novel
ideas that may lead to revolutions in thought.

In addition to writing the thesis, I was required to give multiple extensive
presentations on my research, including a defense, as well as create and present
a poster at the undergraduate natural sciences symposium. Throughout the process
I found a desire for communicating my work to my peers both inside and outside
of my field.  }

Throughout my undergraduate experience, I discovered my zeal for research. In my
commitment to high-energy physics research, I have become attracted to both the
interdisciplinary learning as well as the communication of discoveries required
in the scientific process. 

My experiences at MD Anderson Cancer Center as a medical physics intern and
shadowing a radiation oncologist have motivated my research interests in imaging
to improve early cancer detection or improving current methods of cancer
treatment. One follow-up patient experience in particular has contributed to
these research interests. The patient was an elderly woman who had previously
received radiation treatment to the hilar region of the left lung near her heart
six months prior. 

My decision to pursue a dual degree was spurred by my experiences at MD Anderson
Cancer Center interning for the radiation physics department and shadowing a
radiation oncologist. During my internship, I was exposed to ongoing
developments in image segmentation and registration to improve detection of
radiomic features allowing for the detection of cancer in its early stages. My
experience in the radiation oncology clinic provided additional context and
meaning to their work. Some patients I visited were treated via SBRT where a
very high dose of radiation is administered at the tumor site and the immediate
proximity. While highly effective relative to other treatment methods, it is
limited to small tumors highlighting the impact of the medical physicists' work
in early cancer detection. 

My research in high-energy physics has developed a skill set that will become
increasingly useful in the future of medicine. 

I have chosen to pursue the joint M.D./Ph.D. degrees because
