ASB

Description:

This was a service trip that focused on the gaps in early education for
socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the Houston area. We met once a
week for several months before the trip itself, which took place over the Spring
Break, and discussed the multi-faceted challenges that children in these
communities face in their pursuit of education. During the trip, we volunteered
at two community centers; one which runs a non-profit preschool and another
which held an after school program for elementary school children to provide
them a safe environment.

Most Meaningful:

I was talking to a group of children about the importance of school and
education. When I asked for their favorite subject, a third grader named Juan
enthusiastically said, "Math because of the patterns". I sensed passion in his
answer, so the next day I derived for him the formula for the sum of an
arithmetic series. Then I continued to give a simplified proof that the sum of
all positive integers is -1/12, a peculiar result. He was enthralled by the math
and wanted more. But he did not have access to a computer or the internet and
his parents worked all day so he could not use the resources at the library. In
that moment, I was struck by the tragedy of his situation-- all of his passion
and interest may be wasted due to a lack of resources that I had taken for
granted.

This experience gave me context in the discussion about the socioeconomically
disadvantaged. Economic and educational policies became more personal to me, as
well as immigration policy because there were several students who were illegal
immigrants. It was heartbreaking to hear the community center director talk
about the impact of immigration policies on the children's lives; how they were
painfully aware of the consequences of being an illegal alien. The experience
humbled me and revealed how much of my privilege I had taken for granted. 

================================================================================
my psychology and sociology courses and the weekly meetings leading up to this
trip all suggested that he was fighting an almost losing battle in education.

Every psychology and sociology class at university taught me about generalized
studies on the effects of a low socioeconomic status on the behavioral
development of a child, leading to poor academic performance as a teen, and then
ultimately impacting their adult life. Even though I knew that the generalized
results of a study cannot be accurately applied to the individual, I did not
have the context of a personal relationship with a child of this background to
really understand what this means.

CERN (not going to be one of my most meaningful)

Description: 

I designed and developed the online channel monitoring subsystem for the new
subdetector addition to the CMS detector, which was undergoing an upgrade, at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As the main contact for the channel monitoring
subsystem, I was tasked with independently developing the features of the system
as well as giving weekly reports to the subdetector commission team to update
them on my progress and the functionalities I was implementing in the system.

I designed and developed the online channel monitoring subsystem for the new
subdetector addition to the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. As the
main contact for the channel monitoring subsystem, I was tasked with
independently developing the features of the system as well as presenting weekly
reports to the subdetector commission team on my progress and the
functionalities I was implementing in the system. I learned to think about the
needs of the team and independently developed features that would be useful when
the system was live. This improved my ability to preemptively address potential
issues and cater towards the needs of other roles without requiring their
explicit input.

Most Meaningful:

I learned more than physics and programming from my work at the LHC. Undertaking
the responsibility to produce this important component of the monitoring system
pushed me to develop my collaboration and communication skills. I was required
to breakdown the project into phases to accommodate both the development of
other monitoring subsystems and commissioning tests for the subdetector.
Furthermore, I called regular meetings with individuals from the monitoring team
to determine what information they needed to me monitored. In addition, I
learned to think about the needs of the team and independently developed
features that would be useful when the system was live. This improved my ability
to preemptively address issues and cater towards the needs of roles other than
my own. Lastly, creating and presenting weekly progress reports in front of
dozens of top particle physicists from elite universities sharpened my
communication skills to provide the essential information.

RESEARCHER IN WEI LI HEAVY-ION GROUP

Undergraduate researcher: Total hours: 784 Performed independent analyses of
charged particle multiplicity distributions and extraction of elliptic flow of
Xi baryons in proton-lead collisions leading to senior thesis. Developed
technical and experimental research skills including programming in C-plus-plus
and use of ROOT analysis framework

Temp Research Assistant (Employed post-grad) Total hours: 2080 Hired full-time,
I will expand my senior thesis into a publication as well as undertake
responsibilities in other group analyses and detector projects. Tentative plans
to return to CERN in 2018 to help redevelop the CMS Web Based Monitoring system.

Most Meaningful:

Professor Wei Li has given me numerous opportunities to experience the facets of
research. Independent projects have developed my ability to overcome obstacles
on my own and fostered my intellectual curiosity. The prospect of performing my
own research and having my own lab has grown throughout my experience working
with Professor Li. He has shown me that it is a rewarding experience to make new
discoveries and to teach the next generation of researchers. As a long-term
member of his lab, I had the opportunity to teach the newer undergraduate
members of the lab research techniques that Professor Li had taught me. I
discovered that I really enjoyed teaching them, and this encourages my interest
in owning my own lab and researching my own interests. As a future
physician-scientist, I will be able to make discoveries that benefit medicine
and teach the next generation of researchers.

Working with Professor Wei Li throughout my undergraduate years has opened me to
the life of research. He has provided me with numerous opportunities to learn
the basics of research through independent projects. 


SHADOWING

Description:

Radiation Oncology: (July-August, 2016) & (November 2016-April 2017) Title:
Assistant Professor Dr. Steven Lin, MD, Ph.D.

Medical Physics: (June-August, 2016) Title: Assistant Professor Song Gao, Ph.D.
Contact: songgao@mdanderson.org Description:

During my summer internship in medical physics, I observed stereotactic body
radiation therapy treatments, 4-D radiation therapy simulations, and attended
planning clinics in which medical physicists, dosimetrists, and radiation
oncologists review patient cases for treatment or induction into studies as well
as treatment plans. They also present reports on the progress of current trials
at these meetings.

Most Meaningful:

Medical physicists and radiation oncologists work as a team with dosimetrist to
treat patients. Observing both fields allowed me to follow patients through
their treatment beginning with a consultation, then radiation therapy and weekly
checkups, and finally long term follow-ups. I found that keeping up with the
patient throughout the whole process was a very rewarding experience. Dr. Lin
showed me how to read scans and taught me about the conditions that afflicted
his patients by initially letting me figure out the causes of symptoms before
explaining it in full detail. My shadowing experience with Dr. Lin was
complemented by my observations in medical physics, in which I learned the
technical side of the imaging and treatment methods employed. Ultimately, my
experience shadowing Dr. Lin piqued my interest in the medical sciences and
patient care. 



RICE ALL-STARS

Description:

Rice All-Stars is a student organization in which volunteers play basketball
with individuals who have autism or Down syndrome. As a one-on-one buddy, I was
paired with a special-needs individual for the duration of the season. I chose
to volunteer because I wanted to be more connected with this seemingly
indiscriminate illness, which my family was fortunate enough to not experience,
and use my love for basketball in a helpful way. I am more aware of the care and
compassion these individuals need and I have developed a personal connection to
these syndromes.

================================================================================
I also gained an understanding and appreciation for the patience and love that
is required when taking care of an individual with a learning disability.

NEW LIFE FELLOWSHIP

Description:

A Christian fellowship in which I participated in the Oman House Church. I did
not grow up in a religious environment, so I was interested in exploring
Christianity at university. I have become more open-minded about religion and
have made many lasting relationships through this ministry. It has also allowed
me to connect with patients fighting for their lives during my shadowing
experience. Additionally, I was secretary for my House Church and recorded the
word time and prayer requests of the members. I have also assisted in morning
service breakfast prep as well as other events at the affiliated church such as
the annual crawfish festival.
