Rice All-Stars

A six week basketball program for special-needs children. I was a one-on-one
buddy meaning that I was assigned to a child to play with and supervise every
Sunday. The program was designed to provide a safe space for special-needs
children to express themselves and get physical exercise.

New Life Fellowship

A Christian fellowship in which I participated every Friday in the Oman House
Church to explore Christianity and its ideals. I have acted as secretary for my
House Church recording the word time and prayer requests. Also, I have assisted
in morning service breakfast prep as well as for other events.

ASB

A spring break trip working with disadvantaged elementary school children.
Weekly meetings to learn about issues facing low income students including
effects of immigration policy on the students that are illegal immigrants.
Also listened to teachers and advocates for said demographic.

The demographic also
included some illegal immigrants exposing me firsthand to the impacts of
immigration policy.
