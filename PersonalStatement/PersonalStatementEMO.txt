I have been reminded of death's imminence far more times than is comfortable. I
have a friend whose brother was shot and killed while heroically barricading the
door of the lecture hall so that his classmates could escape. I have a friend
raised by his single father who died in a motor accident the day after I talked
to him. I had a friend whose own life was taken unexpectedly by undiagnosed
hypertropic myopathy three months before our high school graduation. I saw that
life is a game of chance and that at times it is more bitter than sweet. But, I
also learned that despite.

I dedicated four years of my life to earn a degree in physics because I love it,
but during those years I discovered that I love life more. 

My decision to pursue medicine was triggered by my uncle, a physician, who
helped take care of my grandfather during his battle with Alzheimer's. He was
diagnosed my first year at university after it had already progressed for
sometime. He soon began to forget who I was even though he cared for me every
summer during my childhood while my parents were at work. It was hard for
everyone to see him drift in and out of his world of familiar faces on complete
strangers. He would smile acting like he knew us well but it was never the smile
we saw when he could still recognize us. But, we were blessed with my uncle who
knew how to take care of him and was able to answer my family's every question
on short notice. I saw how much suffering he lifted from the shoulders of my
family and myself. I understood the impact of a great physician on the life
patient; on the many lives that surround the patient. 

By the spring semester of my third year in physics, I realized that I did not
want to commit to pure physics research as my life career. While I enjoyed the
research, I felt that I needed something more, and I started to think about what
exactly what I wanted. I was inspired by the role my uncle played in my
grandfather's care and how much I care about people's lives, so I applied to a
medical physics internship at MD Anderson Cancer Center for the following
summer.



For me, being a physician is not just about healing sick patients; it is about
giving back their life to them and their family, their friends, and everyone who
cares for them. I want to get to know my patients dreams and wishes and the life
that they want to have after they get better.  I know that I will not be able to
save all of my patients because at times life is more bitter than sweet... but
at least I can get a say in the matter.
