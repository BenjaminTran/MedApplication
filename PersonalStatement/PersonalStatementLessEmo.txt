I was on a tour of the radiation oncology clinic at MD Anderson Cancer Center
for my medical physics internship. Down the hall I could hear the beeping of
linear accelerators as they ablated tumors with high energy photons at very high
precision. I could see patients exiting treatment rooms after they had received
their radiation. I was surprised. They were laughing and joking with the
technicians and most of them were walking out just fine on their own needing no
assistance at all. If I did not know any better, I would not have suspected that
they were cancer patients. I thought to myself, "This is the power of physics".

I was exploring medical physics at the time because I was seeking to bridge a
gap between two core interests, physics and impacting everyday human lives. In
my four years studying physics, I excitedly learned about the fundamental
phenomena of the universe and it took me abroad to CERN where I contributed to
one of the largest scientific collaborations in the world. But in my third year,
I realized that a career in particle physics research did not excite me. It
seemed very isolated from the world because it was not clear how the direction
of the field would motivate discoveries that would impact our everyday lives.
Medical physics offered a combination that appeared to be a much better fit for
me.

As part of the internship, I was allowed to observe several radiation treatment
procedures, but there was not much patient interaction. I requested to shadow a
radiation oncologist, and I will never forget the miraculous recovery of one of
the follow-up patients. 

The physician pulled up the patient's pre-treatment CT scan from eighteen months
ago. He pointed out that the lung cancer had metastasized with lesions up and
down his mediastinum indicated by more than a dozen black spots on the scan. I
suspected that he had brought it up as a past case study, but then he surprised
me, "Let's go check on him". I followed him to the exam room not sure what to
expect because I knew with cancer that severe the chance of recurrence is high.
We stepped into the room and his family was waiting with him. They greeted us
with visibly tense smiles and he asked about their lives, what the children were
up to, just catching up. Finally, he pulled up the patient's pre-treatment CT
scan and then one from earlier that day. We all let out a sigh, theirs in
relief, mine in awe. Every lesion was gone. His scan was clean and clear of the
black spots besides a new one which the physician explained they were continuing
to monitor but that it had not grown in size since the last visit. They thanked
him with glowing smiles and unburdened laughter. After we left the room, he
explained to me that the patient was enrolled in an immunotherapy with
concomitant radiation trial. I expressed my amazement and the physician
reciprocated. He assured me that it was not always like that but that case shows
the potential. I asked him for literature on immunotherapy later that day amazed
that physics and medicine joined together had caused such a drastic change in
the patient's life.

In the following months, I continued to shadow him observing all of the skills,
beyond just vast knowledge, that it takes to be a physician. I was amazed by the
array of interpersonal skills that he mustered to console patients; some crying
after receiving news of a suspicious spot on the CT scan, one fed up with an
error of bureaucratic nature and wanting to switch hospitals. I heard patients
tell their stories and all of the things that they wanted to do. I realized that
just wanting to make an impact on our everyday lives was a vague dream of mine.
What I really wanted now was to be the person actively impacting people's
everyday life. I wanted to do what physicians do on a daily basis. 

But I was hesitant to leave behind particle physics research. I enjoyed writing
analysis code to mine large amounts of data. I discussed my hesitation with the
physician. He explained to me that I was actually in a unique position. Medicine
was rapidly evolving with the quick improvements in technology of the recent
decades. He assured me that if I pursue medicine, I could apply my skills in
imaging or bioinformatics research to name a few; the possibilities were quickly
opening up in this new age of medicine. Furthermore, the medical community
needed more individuals with technical skills to continue the marriage of modern
technology and medicine. I reflected upon the opportunities that lay ahead of me
and my hesitation disappeared.

As a physician, I want to do more than just heal sick patients; it is about
giving back their lives to them and their family, their friends, and everyone
who cares for them. It is about getting to know my patients' dreams and wishes
and the life that they want after they get better because I want them to live it
all out. I want them to know that I will be fighting for them no matter how good
or bad the prognosis. As a physician, I also want to use my unique skill set to
contribute to the field of medicine in research and make discoveries that will
impact more than just the relatively few people that I can care for in my
lifetime. I know I may not be able to save all of my patients but at least I can
give them a fighting chance.
