 Down the hall I could hear the beeping of linear accelerators as they ablated
 tumors using high energy photons with pinpoint precision. I was on a tour of
 the radiation oncology clinic at MD Anderson Cancer Center for my medical
 physics internship. I could see cancer patients exiting treatment rooms after
 they had received their radiation. I was surprised. They were laughing and
 joking with the technicians and most of them were walking without any need of
 assistance, a stark contrast to the gravity of their diagnosis. I thought to
 myself, "This is the power of physics".

I was exploring medical physics seeking to bridge a gap between my two core
interests -- physics and impacting everyday human lives. During my study of
physics, I excitedly learned about the fundamental phenomena of the universe,
from the motion of protons in an electric field, to the quantum dynamics of its
spin, and eventually leading way to the principles of the MRI.  My journey in
physics even took me abroad to CERN where I contributed to one of the largest
scientific collaborations in the world. Despite these amazing experiences, I
realized that a career in particle physics research did not excite me. It seemed
isolated from the world because it was not clear how the direction of the field
would motivate discoveries that would impact our everyday lives. Medical physics
offered a combination that appeared to be a much better fit for me.

As part of the internship, I was allowed to observe radiation treatment
procedures. I wanted to see physics in action, but I discovered a desire to
interact with the patients even more. I requested to shadow a radiation
oncologist, and will never forget the miraculous treatment outcome of one of the
follow-up patients. 

The physician pulled up the patient's pre-treatment CT scan from eighteen months
ago. He pointed out the lung cancer that had metastasized with lesions up and
down his mediastinum indicated by more than a dozen black spots on the scan.
Given the grave prognosis, I suspected the patient had passed away and he had
brought it up as a case study. However, much to my surprise, he said, "Let's go
check on him". I followed him to the exam room unsure of what to expect because
I knew the chance of recurrence is high for widely metastasized cancers. The
patient and his family greeted us with visibly tense smiles and quick, nervous
handshakes. I noticed the physician's lighthearted and jovial personality
beginning to ease them. As he joked with them, the tension in their bodies
melted and their laughter lost all traces of nervousness. Then, he pulled up the
patient's CT scans, the one he had shown me and one from earlier that day. We
all let out a sigh -- theirs in relief, mine in awe. His scan was clean and
clear of the black spots besides one which the physician explained was being
monitored but had not grown in size since the last visit six months ago.
Everyone thanked the physician for saving not just the patient's life but all of
theirs as well. He returned their lives back to a sense of normalcy. After we
left the room, he explained that the results were due to the patient's
enrollment in an immunotherapy with concomitant radiation trial to test the
efficacy of joining these separate treatment methods. I expressed my amazement
and the physician reciprocated. He assured me that results like those did not
occur often but that case shows the potential of the treatment protocol. In
curiosity, I asked him for literature on radiation and immunotherapy. I never
considered the joining of medicine and physics in such an intimate manner.
Amazed by the power of this union, I began to consider medicine as a career.

In the following months, I continued to shadow him and observed the array of
interpersonal skills that it takes to be a physician. I was amazed by his
ability to console patients; some crying after receiving news of a suspicious
spot on the CT scan, others fed up with backlogged procedures due to
bureaucratic errors. I heard patients tell their stories and talk about their
goals, goals that they could do now that he made them cancer free. Interacting
with the patients clarified my desire to impact our everyday lives. I wanted to
be the person directly impacting people's lives; to give them hope and assurance
in their time of need. While my desire to pursue medicine grew, I was hesitant
to leave behind particle physics research. I enjoyed writing analysis code and
exploring the most fundamental aspects of nature. I discussed my hesitation with
the physician. He thought my interests were not conflicting at all, to the
contrary they put me in a unique position. Medicine is rapidly evolving with the
quick improvements in technology of the recent decades. He explained to me that
if I pursued medicine, I could apply my honed problem solving and programming
skills to improve medicine by continuing its integration with developing
technologies, and encouraged me to consider becoming a physician-scientist to
use my research background as a strong foundation for making substantial and
impactful discoveries. I reflected upon all the opportunities ahead of me and my
hesitation disappeared.

As a physician, I want to do more than just heal sick patients. I want to know
them, truly care for them, and give them the chance to live their life again. I
want to explore medicine and apply my skills to make discoveries that can impact
more than just the patients that I will be able to personally care for in my
lifetime. I know I may not be able to save all of my patients but at least I can
give all of them a fighting chance.
