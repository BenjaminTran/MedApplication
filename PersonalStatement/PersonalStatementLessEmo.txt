Down the hall I heard the beeping of linear accelerators as they ablated tumors
using high-energy photons with pinpoint precision. I witnessed the power of
physics in medicine as cancer patients exited treatment rooms after receiving
therapy. They were laughing, they were joking and most of them were walking
without any need of assistance, a stark contrast to the gravity of their
condition.

I interned in medical physics at MD Anderson Cancer Center because I was seeking
to bridge a gap between my two core interests -- physics and impacting everyday
human lives. During my study of physics, I fervently learned about the
fundamental phenomena of the universe, from the motion of protons in an electric
field, to the quantum dynamics of its spin and eventually leading to the
principles of the MRI. My journey in physics brought me to the Large Hadron
Collider, the largest particle accelerator in the world, where I helped design
the online monitoring system for the detector. My in-depth experiences in
physics has shown me its power, but I really wanted to explore its integration
with healthcare delivery. Through my medical physics internship, I observed
radiation treatment procedures and the miraculous potential of physics combined
with modern medicine. I also discovered even stronger desires to interact with
the patients and play a long-term role in their therapy from consultation to
post-treatment follow-up leading to my shadowing experience with Dr. Steven Lin,
the radiation oncologist for several of the patients I observed. I will never
forget the miraculous recovery of a patient he treated that highlighted the
power of medicine.

Dr. Lin enlarged the patient's FDG scan on the screen, it was from eighteen
months ago. Over a dozen FDG avid lesions, indicated by black regions, peppered
the mediastinum, his lung cancer had aggressively metastasized. My heart sank
and I wondered how long ago he had passed away, but before I could ask, Dr. Lin
stood up and said, "Let's go check on him". I did not realize that he was there
for a follow-up. The patient and his family greeted us with visibly tense smiles
and nervous handshakes; they were waiting to review the follow-up scan. Dr.
Lin's lighthearted and jovial personality began to ease them, and as he told
jokes, the tension in their bodies melted and their laughter lost almost all
traces of distress. Then, he pulled up an FDG scan with today's date. We all let
out a sigh -- theirs in relief, mine in awe. His scan was clear of cancer. Their
eyes glistened with tears as they thanked Dr. Lin for returning their lives back
to a sense of normalcy. Afterwards, he explained to me that the results were due
to a trial protocol where immunotherapy is administered with concurrent
radiation therapy. In curiosity, I asked him for literature on this combined
treatment method. As I read the papers, I was impressed by the potential of
joining radiation physics with pharmaceutical medicine; it saved the patient
from certain death. 

After the internship, I continued to shadow Dr. Lin and observed the need for
excellent bedside manners. More often than I had hoped, Dr. Lin would deliver
crushing news of suspicious activity on scans to terrified patients, and almost
every time, I saw tears in their eyes and fought them from forming in mine. But,
Dr. Lin gave them options, assured them that there were ways to fight the
cancer. He reminded both the patient and me that cancer was not the death knell
it once was, not with the capabilities of modern medicine. His impeccable
bedside manner showed when he calmed a patient who was infuriated, fists
clenched and threatening to change hospitals due to numerous errors in his
treatment schedule. I watched Dr. Lin as he acknowledged the patient's
frustration, and showed his compassion and commitment to providing the patient
with the best treatment possible. Within ten minutes the patient was thanking
Dr. Lin for convincing him to stay. The need for superb bedside manner was never
demonstrated more clearly than in that situation; I was astonished. Throughout
my patient interaction experiences I wanted to comfort the patient and tell them
that they are in good hands, but I remained silent allowing Dr. Lin to provide
words of comfort. Hearing their struggles and pain moved me, and so has
witnessing their triumphs over cancer. I want to impact the lives of patients by
giving them assurance and the ability to fight illness in their greatest time of
need. 

As a physician, I want to do more than just heal sick patients. I want to know
them, truly care for them, and give them the chance to live their life again. I
want to explore medicine and apply my background in physics and research towards
its advancement, so I can impact more than just the patients I will personally
care for in my lifetime. I cannot save all of my patients, but at least I can
give them a fighting chance.

He explained that I was in a unique position. Medicine is rapidly evolving to
include the technological improvements of recent decades with no signs of
slowing down. I can directly contribute towards this integration using my
programming skills and my knowledge in physics. He encouraged me to consider
becoming a physician-scientist to use my research background as a strong
foundation for making substantial and impactful discoveries. I reflected upon my
place in the future of medicine and all hesitation disappeared. 

In addition to working in the clinic, I also want to apply my research skills.
My background in physics and computational research provides me with a unique
perspective to tackle problems of modern medicine which are increasingly
technologically involved.

I know I may not be able to save all of my patients but at least I can give all
of them a fighting chance.
