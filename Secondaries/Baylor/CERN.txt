I had always wanted to visit the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN) in Switzerland ever since I had heard about it as a child. So, when my PI
offered me a summer internship at CERN, I jumped on the opportunity. The
experience pushed me outside of my comfort zone and taught me many important
life skills.

In my work at CERN, I gained many skills that have proved useful, but one of the
most important skills was being able to ask the right questions. Since my work
was completely software related, I often needed to consult with the relevant
experts. However, due to the commissioning of the detector, those experts had
busy schedules limiting the time I had to ask them questions. This forced me to
craft questions that would lead to information dense answers, which I was able
to use to infer answers to other questions I had. This skill has been very
useful and is one that physicians need in order to acquire as much information
from the patient as efficiently as possible.

Aside from the work experience I gained during my internship, I acquired
perspective about myself and the world. I discovered my love for the unbridled
peace of the mountains while hiking in the Swiss Juras and Alps. I also became
more confident as I travelled alone forcing me to overcome my anxiety of
striking up conversations with people whom I may have nothing in common. My
views broadened as I talked to others and learned about how their culture
influenced what they believe is important in life. This led me to ask myself
what I thought was most important in my life and what I really wanted to do with
it, which ultimately led to my decision to pursue medicine.

My internship at CERN was an experience that matured my appreciation for life.
Since then, I have applied the skills that I developed in my research work. I
have also taken every opportunity to travel outdoors to the mountains of
Colorado or Big Bend in Texas. But more importantly, I appreciate everyone's
perspective and no longer struggle with the social obstacles that having
different personal backgrounds can cause.

I was completely outside of my comfort zone. Until then I had never travelled
alone and definitely not abroad. However, it forced me to overcome 

One of the benefits of working at CERN was being surrounded by people from all
around the world. I lived with and worked with people of diverse backgrounds
leading to interesting conversations about how other countries tackle problems
such as healthcare, which interested me because I did not have health insurance
until the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The conversations I had with these
people broadened my understanding of the world and I developed an even deeper
appreciation for different perspectives.

================================================================================

Before my summer internship, I had never travelled outside of the U.S. When I
was a child, my family did not have the money to travel abroad and neither did
my parents feel there was a need to see more of the world. As refugees of the
Vietnam War, they moved through many refugee camps in different countries and
thought that they had seen more than enough. Their views had an influence on my
thoughts about the importance of travelling abroad, and, prior to the
experience, I did not realize how much of an impact going abroad would have on
me.

It was not cheap to travel there, and even though I would only stay for ten
weeks, the cost of living was high. My family did not have enough money to
support me, and so it did not seem as though I would be able to take advantage
of the opportunity. However, I was able to apply for and receive a fellowship
from the Shell Foundation through Rice, which covered a large portion of the
expenses. The rest of the money came from my own savings as well as my aunts and
uncles who recognized the opportunity for me and contributed generously. If it
were not for my family and the generous philanthropists at the Shell Foundation,
I would not have been able to make it.

I have found the skill of formulating these kinds of
questions to be very important in not only obtaining information but also
delivering it as well in the sense that I can formulate such questions that my
audience may have and then preemptively answer them.

In
particular, interacting and collaborating with top physicists from all around
the world during my internship gave me a significant experience working in a
team environment.
