I had always wanted to visit the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN) in Switzerland ever since I heard about it as a child. When my PI
offered me a summer internship at CERN I jumped on the opportunity. The
experience opened me up to the world outside of the U.S. and allowed me to
explore myself.

Throughout my internship, I often found myself extended outside of my comfort
zone. I undertook a large responsibility creating the front end software for the
channel monitoring system and I gained many skills in the process. In
particular, interacting and collaborating with top physicists from all around
the world during my internship gave me a significant experience working in a
team environment. However, one of the most important skills I developed was
asking the right questions. Due to the commissioning of the detector, the
software experts had very busy schedules and so I had limited time to ask
questions. This forced me to learn how to craft questions that would lead to
information dense answers, a skill that is useful for physicians.

Aside from the work experience I gained during my internship, I acquired
perspective about myself and the world. I discovered my love for the unbridled
peace of the mountains while hiking in the Swiss Juras and Alps. I also became
more self-reliant and confident as I travelled alone allowing me to overcome my
anxiety of talking to people from completely different backgrounds, which I
realized was among the most interesting aspects of travelling. I learned about
how other people live and what other people find important in life leading me to
ask myself that question-- ultimately leading me to pursue medicine.

It was a lasting experience that instructed me in how to work and how to live.
Since then, I have applied the skills that I developed in my research and work
and communication. I have also taken every opportunity to travel outdoors to the
mountains of Colorado or Big Bend in Texas. But more importantly, I appreciate
everyone's perspective and no longer view different personal backgrounds as a
social obstacle but as an opportunity to learn more.

I was completely outside of my comfort zone. Until then I had never travelled
alone and definitely not abroad. However, it forced me to overcome 

One of the benefits of working at CERN was being surrounded by people from all
around the world. I lived with and worked with people of diverse backgrounds
leading to interesting conversations about how other countries tackle problems
such as healthcare, which interested me because I did not have health insurance
until the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The conversations I had with these
people broadened my understanding of the world and I developed an even deeper
appreciation for different perspectives.

================================================================================

Before my summer internship, I had never travelled outside of the U.S. When I
was a child, my family did not have the money to travel abroad and neither did
my parents feel there was a need to see more of the world. As refugees of the
Vietnam War, they moved through many refugee camps in different countries and
thought that they had seen more than enough. Their views had an influence on my
thoughts about the importance of travelling abroad, and, prior to the
experience, I did not realize how much of an impact going abroad would have on
me.

It was not cheap to travel there, and even though I would only stay for ten
weeks, the cost of living was high. My family did not have enough money to
support me, and so it did not seem as though I would be able to take advantage
of the opportunity. However, I was able to apply for and receive a fellowship
from the Shell Foundation through Rice, which covered a large portion of the
expenses. The rest of the money came from my own savings as well as my aunts and
uncles who recognized the opportunity for me and contributed generously. If it
were not for my family and the generous philanthropists at the Shell Foundation,
I would not have been able to make it.

I have found the skill of formulating these kinds of
questions to be very important in not only obtaining information but also
delivering it as well in the sense that I can formulate such questions that my
audience may have and then preemptively answer them.
