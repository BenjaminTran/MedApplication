Prompt: Describe the setting in which you envision conducting your medical
career. Also include how and why you think this setting would help fulfill your
interests related to the practice of medicine.

The choice of setting for my medical career is dependent upon my specific
interests in medicine as well as personal reasons. I have a strong intention to
return to Texas to conduct my medical career, specifically the Texas Medical
Center. The close vicinity of my undergraduate institution, Rice University, to
the Texas Medical Center has provided me several opportunities to explore why it
is a good fit for my interests.

I believe the Texas medical center is conducive for my interests in academic research
in cancer and teaching while also allowing me to provide state-of-the-art
treatment options for cancer patients.
