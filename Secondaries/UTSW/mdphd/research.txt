Describe the type of research you are currently most interested in pursuing for
your PhD training. You can be general or specific (e.g., genetics, biochemistry,
protein structure/function studies, rational drug design, Alzheimer's disease,
etc.)

I have multiple interests and want to explore the potential avenues of research
at Southwestern. I am currently interested in imaging techniques and methods and
their applications in identifying illnesses such as cancer or improving our
understanding of the human body. I am also interested in computational methods
of big data analysis such as in machine learning or deep learning and its
application to many areas of research in medicine such as protein folding,
pharmaceutical drug discovery, bioinformatics, and imaging once again.
