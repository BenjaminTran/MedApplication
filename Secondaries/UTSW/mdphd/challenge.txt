If you wish, please described major hardships or adversity you have overcome to
reach this point in your life (if none, please state "none").

For six years in my childhood, I lived with only my mother. She was able to keep
us barely financially stable but that meant she needed to work long hours at two
jobs. This had an impact on many aspects of my life. Due to her long work hours
and our financial situation, I did not have access to nutritious or healthy food
options. I also did not have access to many books at home or educational and
extracurricular opportunities outside of public schooling.

Later in my life, our financial situation improved and we moved to a suburb of
Houston where my father had been living. However, financing higher education was
still a problem. However, I qualified for Rice University's financial assistance
program and they covered the full cost of tuition allowing me to attend the
university and achieve all that I have done so far in my life. The financial
struggles of my youth and the consequent disadvantages used to impact me
emotionally, however, these feelings have been replaced with great appreciation
and understanding of the impact generous individuals and institutions in society
have had on my life.
