Why are you interested in MD/PHD training at UTSW in particular?

I am interested in the MSTP at UT Southwestern because it offers me flexibility
in both my medical education and my life. The wide breadth of research
opportunities at Southwestern and the surrounding institutions in the Dallas
Medical Center allows me to explore many of my research interests, and is also
conducive for interdisciplinary research as well. In particular, the Advanced
Imaging Research Center will allow me to explore my main interest in imaging
techniques and analysis. In addition to the research opportunities, the medical
education is comprehensive and fellow classmates who enrolled at Southwestern
have informed me that there are numerous clinical opportunities for students to
directly perform in medical procedures.

Additionally, the diversity of Dallas and its close proximity to my hometown of
Houston has influenced my decision as well. I have visited the Dallas area
several times before and enjoy the cultural diversity in music and arts, so I am
familiar with the area and can envision myself living there for an extended
period of time while I complete the MSTP. Also, I can also easily travel back
home to visit my family and cousins in Houston throughout my educational
journey.
