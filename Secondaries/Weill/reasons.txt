Please write a brief statement giving your reasons for applying to Weill Cornell
Medical College. Please limit your statement to less than 200 words.

I am drawn to the Weill Cornell medical institution because of the superb
educational and research opportunities.  Given my past research experience
working with big data in heavy-ion physics and my current research interests in
the applications of machine learning and data science to cancer diagnosis and
treatment, I believe that Weill's Tri-Institutional partnership offers many
opportunities for me to explore and contribute to this branch of medicine.

The location of Weill within New York City is also an important factor in my
decision.  Coming from Houston, a large and diverse city itself, I appreciate
the cultural value that many different communities bring to the area through
art, music, and food to name a few.  I believe that the diversity of New York
provides a great opportunity for me to continue expanding my horizons in caring
for and understanding broader demographics in not only my everyday life, but as
a potential future practicing physician as well.
