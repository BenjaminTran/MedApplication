By the end of my summer internship at CERN, I had nearly completed my monitoring
software project with the exception of completely debugging the software, which
was delayed by detector commissioning tests preventing me from testing my code.
A student from MIT was to take my place to finish my project, however, I did not
want to leave it incomplete and because I wrote the software, I knew that I
would be the best person to debug it.  I chose to continue working on the project
with the MIT student after I returned to the US.

The largest problem was that CERN was seven hours ahead, which combined with
commissioning tests, meant that my software testing had to be done in a narrow
window during the night at CERN.  Therefore, I coordinated with the MIT student
to design test cases in order to narrow down the location of the bug during the
day and then deploy each test at night when we had access to observe the
behavior of the system.  After several days, we located and fixed the bug and
officially deployed the software to the detector for use.
