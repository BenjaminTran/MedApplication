By the end of my summer internship at CERN, I had nearly completed my monitoring
software project with the exception of finding the last bug in the sotware. This
process was delayed by detector commissioning tests preventing me from testing
my code. A student from MIT was to take my place to finish my project. However,
I did not want to leave my project incomplete and because I wrote the software,
I knew that I would be the best person to debug it, so I chose to continue
working on the project with the MIT student. The challenge was that I would have
to work remotely from the U.S. making coordination with those at CERN even more
difficult on top of the many ongoing detector commissioning tests.

The largest problem was that CERN was seven hours ahead, which combined with
commissioning tests, meant that my software testing had to be done in a narrow
window during night time at CERN. Therefore, I coordinated with the MIT student
to produce test cases in order to identify the location of the bug during the
day and then deploy each test at night when we had access. Eventually, we
found the bug and was able to officially deploy the software to the detector for
use.
